# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Summary
- The purpose of this project is to Visualizing Earthquake Data.  The tools that will be using for visualization are: Mapbox, leaflet and javascript.  We took the earthquake data for the past 7 days in the world and put in a map where is showing the magnitude of each earthquake and is represented as a circle marker and the size of the circle depends on the earthquake magnitude.  The user will be able to see different map titles, in this case are: street map, satellite map and the light map.  We also added the tectonic plates layer to the map.  The user will be able to swicth between the map titles and add or remove the circle markers for eartquake data and tectonic plates.  We added a bindPopup with earthquake information about the magnitude and location.
